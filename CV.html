               <h3><a href="https://github.com/daniel-meilak/vampire/tree/develop/util/vdc">VDC</a> (VAMPIRE Data Converter) - rewrote and added functionality to a visualisation tool which digests and outputs nanoscale material structures in several formats, including chemical file (.xyz) and raster image formats. The tool can also be used to visualise slices of the system to better understand physical phenomena.</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3><a href="https://github.com/daniel-meilak/Advent-of-Code-2021">Advent of Code</a> - Completed all 7 years of advent of code in C++. First started in 2019, the solutions improve in efficiency and coding style each year due to better understanding of C++ and the STL. All solutions are uploaded to GitHub and can be built on Windows/Unix using CMake to compile and test.</h3>

            </li>
            <li>
               <p><b>Teaching</b> - “Advanced Computational Laboratory”, helping students to write research style computational projects in various languages.  “Mathematics I”, running practicals for students to practice solving various mathematical equations.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
